          <p class="caption">I was born in Madrid but grew up as a Third Culture Kid. I got to spend a lot of time living in different places but my heart belongs to Madrid.</p>

           <p class="caption"><strong>I've had a non-linear journey to research in psychology</strong></p>
          <p class="caption">I attended NYU where I began my academic journey studying International Politics. I also completeted two minors: Computer Science and Child & Adolescent Mental Health.
                           I became increasingly intersted in the psychology of the people in the room during moments of stress (i.e. political crises!). This led me to studying mood and personality disoders at the Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine. I became passionate about the methods of psychological research so I went to get a MS at Fordham so I could focus on quantitative psychology.
                             Getting to apply data driven models and multi-modal methods to understand severe mental illness was exciting so I knew my journey would lead to an interdisciplinary PhD!

           <p class="caption"><strong>My multilinguality influences my interest in the role of language in behavior.</strong></p>
          <p class="caption"> Behariors are communicated differently in every language. Our thoughts and our conceptualization of our behaviors are communicated via language, yet there are many factors that inflences the language we use and what we ultimately convey. In fact, mental health issues are primarily diagnosted and treated using this method but everyone has a very different conceptualization of their feelings and behaviors. 
                              These insights have guided my interests on the role of language in behavioral prediction and understanding. In line with this, I'm passionate about the role of LLMs; both how we communicate with these models and how they understand us.</p>

          <p class="caption"><strong>Outside of my research, animals are my life!</strong></p>
           <p class="caption">My dogs Bimba and Alfie have been my companions for a long time and their presence has been key in all my academic success! I am also an active equestrian. My horse Karlos has taught me a lot of lessons which have translated to my doctoral journey.</p>
