          <p class="caption"><strong>¡Hola! My name is Maria and I'm from Madrid, Spain.</strong></p>
          <p class="caption">Although I was born in Madrid, I grew up as a Third Culture Kid. I got to spend a lot of time living in different places and learning from people from all over the world. These experience shaped how I approach teams </p>

           <p class="caption"><strong>I've had a non-linear journey to research in psychology</strong></p>
          <p class="caption">I attended NYU where I began my academic journey studying International Politics (with minors in computer science and child & adolescent mental health).
                           I became increasingly intersted in the personality psychology of the people in the room during moments of political crises. This led me to studying mood and personality disoders at the Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine's Mood and Personality Disorders Unit. I became passionate about the methods of psychological research which lead me to grad school so I could focus on quantitative psychology.
                             Getting to apply data driven models and multi-modal methods to understand severe mental illness was exciting so I knew my journey would lead to an interdisciplinary PhD!

           <p class="caption"><strong>My multilinguality influences my interest in the role of language in behavior.</strong></p>
          <p class="caption">Our thoughts and our conceptualization of our behaviors are communicated via language, yet there are many factors that inflences the language we use and what we ultimately convey to the listener (be it a person or an AI!). </p>
            <p class="caption"> These insights have guided my interests on the role of language and large language models in behavioral prediction, treatment, and etiology research. </p>

           <p class="caption">My dogs Bimba and Alfie have been my companions for a long time and their presence has been key in all my academic success! I am also an active equestrian. My horse Karlos has taught me a lot of lessons which have translated to my doctoral journey.</p>
